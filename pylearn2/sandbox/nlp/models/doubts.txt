h
Note that in the above equation we used sθ (w, h) in place of log Pθ (w), ignoring the normalization
term, because we are working with an unnormalized model. We can do this because the NCE
objective encourages the model to be approximately normalized and recovers a perfectly normalized
model if the model class contains the data distribution [6].
